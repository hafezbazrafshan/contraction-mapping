# The contraction mapping project

This set of MATLAB codes numerically verify that the Z-Bus method is a contraction mapping on IEEE distribution test networks. Additionally, the Z-Bus load-flow and the Forward-backward sweep load-flow are also implemented.  See also our [three-phase modeling repository](https://github.com/hafezbazrafshan/three-phase-modeling).
